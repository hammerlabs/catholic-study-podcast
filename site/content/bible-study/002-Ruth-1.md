Description = "Naomi leaves Moab after the deaths of her husband and two sons. She declares that her name is no longer Naomi, but Marah. I'm not pleasant anymore but bitterness is what defines me. She pushes her two daughters-in-law away, but one refuses to leave. Ruth sees hope in the God of Abraham and she will not be turned away. (Pictured: 'Naomi and her Daughters-in-law' Woodcut by Gustave Dor√©)"
